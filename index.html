        My name is Shrayan Chaudhuri, currently pursuing my Masters in Information Technology and Management with a specialization in Data Analytics and Management. I have 5 years of prior industry experience under my belt and worked as a Middleware Integration Developer for companies like Wipro and Accenture. Now, I am taking a pivot and wants to get into the field of Data Engineering/ Analytics. Coming from the field of backend I was never exposed to the front-end technologies and have very basic experience with HTML and CSS. But, I am hoepful that this course will teach me the basic understanding of how to create a web application.
